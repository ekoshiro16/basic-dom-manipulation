// The tortoise and the hare both run at different speeds, so it will help to have a visual tool to see how they run. 

// First, write some JS code that styles each .race-square-tortoise element's background color to green. He's quite slow, so he has to step on each individual race tile.

// However, the hare is much faster. He can run so fast that he can go three tiles at a time. Write some JS code that styles each third .race-square-hare element's background color to pink to represent the hare's pace of running. 

// Lastly... there is a surprise competitor! It's the famous Japanese shinkansen bullet train! It's a little bit faster than the hare, so write some JS code that styles each 10th .race-square-train element's background color to grey. Hopefully that's not too big of a pace advantage...
